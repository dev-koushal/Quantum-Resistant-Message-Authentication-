# Quantum-Resistant Message Authentication

## Project Description

The Quantum-Resistant Message Authentication project is a cutting-edge blockchain solution designed to provide secure, future-proof message storage and authentication on the Ethereum network. This smart contract implements post-quantum cryptographic principles to ensure message security even in the face of potential quantum computing threats.

The system features a unique "Quantum Canary" mechanism that monitors for quantum computing advances and automatically upgrades security protocols when threats are detected. Messages are time-locked with increasing security requirements and include multi-layered authentication processes to maintain integrity and confidentiality.
